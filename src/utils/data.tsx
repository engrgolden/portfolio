It covered everything from JSX, components, props, and state management, to advanced concepts like context, custom hooks, and performance optimization. The course also included real-world projects that reinforced best practices in writing clean, maintainable code and working with reusable UI components. I gained hands-on experience integrating Redux for state management, handling asynchronous operations, and using Next.js for server-side rendering and routing. Completing this certification solidified my ability to build dynamic, production-ready React applications from start to finish.",

I learned how to design RESTful APIs, connect Node.js backends to MongoDB databases, manage authentication with JWT, and deploy secure, scalable applications. The course emphasized modular architecture, real-world debugging, and performance optimization strategies. On the frontend, I deepened my understanding of React hooks, component lifecycles, and efficient state updates. By the end of the course, I developed and deployed several full-featured applications, gaining the confidence to architect and maintain complex web solutions independently.",
